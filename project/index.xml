      <description>Nam Nguyen nhn325Summary: I retrieved the college_recent_grads dataset from the fivethirtyeight library and retrieved the dataset about degree salaries online from Kaggle.com. Kaggle says its from Wallstreet Journal and that it was updated 3 years ago. The variables in the college_recent_grad dataset observe variables pertaining to college majors such as major-type, sex, employment, and unemployment. The variables in the major_salaries dataset has variables also pertaining to college majors such as starting median salary and mid-career salary.</description>

      <description>Nam Nguyen nhn325Summary: I found the dataset on Professor Salaries from the carData library. The variables in this dataset are professors’ rank (Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor), discipline (A=‘Theoretical’, B=‘Applied’), number of years since phd (yrs.since.phd), number of years in service (yrs.service), sex (male or female), and nine month salary (U.S. dollars). The data was collected over a 9 month period in 2008 and 2009 in hopes of finding out whether sex affected professor salaries.</description>
