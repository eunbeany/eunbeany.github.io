##### An example of how Python and R can be used together through the use of reticulate

```{r}
library(reticulate) # R
```

```{python}
import numpy as np # Python
mat1=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
```

```{r}
mat2<-solve(py$mat1) #finding inverse matrix in R
mat2
```
```{python}
np.dot(mat1,r.mat2).round() #matrix multiplication in Python
```
