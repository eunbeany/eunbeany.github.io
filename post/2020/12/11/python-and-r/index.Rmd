##### An example of how Python and R can be used together through the use of reticulate

```{r}
library(reticulate) #access the reticulate library in R
```

```{python}
import numpy as np #import numpy from Python
mat1=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]]) #initiate matrix as mat1
mat1
```

```{r}
mat2<-solve(py$mat1) #find the inverse matrix (mat2) in R
mat2
```
```{python}
np.dot(mat1,r.mat2).round() #matrix multiplication within Python
```
