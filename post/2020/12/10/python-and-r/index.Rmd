##### An example of how Python and R can be used together through the use of reticulate
```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

##### Here we use the numpy library in Python to make a numpy matrix
```{python}
import numpy as np
mat1=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
```

##### Using the Solve function in R, the inverse of the matrix is found
```{r}
mat2<-solve(py$mat1)
mat2
```
##### And we go back to Python to multiply the original matrix with the inverse. Identity Matrix!
```{python}
np.dot(mat1,r.mat2).round()
```
