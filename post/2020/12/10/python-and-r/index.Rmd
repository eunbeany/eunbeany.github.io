##### An example of how Python and R can be used together through the use of reticulate

```{r}
library(reticulate) # Load R Reticulate library
```

```{python}
import numpy as np # Import the Numpy library from Python
mat1=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])
```

```{r}
mat2<-solve(py$mat1) # Calculate the Inverse matrix in R using the numpy matrix from Python
mat2
```
```{python}
np.dot(mat1,r.mat2).round # Back to Python- using matrix multiplication to find the Inverse Matrix
```
